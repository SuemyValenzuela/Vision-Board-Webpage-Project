<ol>
  <li><strong>Graduate college with honors:</strong> This is one of my objectives since I've always wanted to better myself, because <em>I want to be my father's pride</em> and therefore be able to tell others that everything is possible in life if you work hard enough.</li>
  <li><strong>Travel around the world:</strong> I've always been curious about new things and cultures, which is why I added it because I want to travel to other countries and <em>bring my family along</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Buy a big house with a sea view:</strong> I'd want to have <em>multiple residences</em>, one of which would have a view of the sea; I think spending holidays or hosting parties on the beach would be really enjoyable.</li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align:center">This is me:</p>
  <p style="text-align:center"><img width= 300; height= auto src="Me.jpg" alt="Me Image"></p>
  
<ul style="text-align:right">
  <li><strong>Picture of me and my whole family:</strong> I added a photo of my family because they are such an <em>essential part of my life</em> and have always been there to support me.</li>
  <li><strong>Picture with my best friends:</strong> This year, I met a lot of people, but three of them, <em>Antonella, Isabella, and Chris</em>, have become very important and close to me.</li>
  <li><strong>Picture with my siblings:</strong> My siblings are very vital to me; I share many things with them, like <em>happiness, affection for one another, and care</em>.</li>

  <h2 style="text-align:left; color:#F48FB1;"> &#10024;INSPIRING&#10024;</h2>

<ol style="text-align:center">
  <li><strong>Try to be a rainbow in someone’s cloud – Maya Angelou:</strong> For me, this implies that <em>you are another person's light</em>, that you are there to support and listen to them when they are in difficulty. That we must be there for the person when they are most in need.</li>
  <li><strong>Picture of my family:</strong> <em>My family is my source of motivation</em>. They motivate me to improve every day, follow my goals, and never give up.</li>
  <li><strong>“I can do all this through him who gives me strength” – Philippians 4:13:</strong> This quote is really meaningful to me because <em>I believe in God</em> and know that I can do anything through him since he is always with me, even when I can't see him.</li>

  <h2 style="text-align:left; color:#D32F2F;"> &#128150;SPECIAL MEANING ITEMS&#128150;</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Picture of me and my friends in Halloween:</strong> My friends and I decided to <em>dress up like food</em> for Halloween, which turned out to be a lot of fun. It was particularly memorable because we did it together, regardless of what others may have said.</li>
  <li><strong>Picture of me in the Honor Roll:</strong> Being on the honor roll means a lot to me because it shows me that <em>everything is possible if you put up the work</em>. I was still studying English at the time.</li>
  <li><strong>Picture of me and my dad and siblings:</strong> The photo with my dad and siblings exemplifies our <em>strong love</em> for one another.</li>

  <h2 style="text-align:left; color:#F57C00;"> &#128293;VISUALIZATION OF MY FEELINGS&#128293;</h2>

<ol style="text-align:right">
  <li><strong>"Never dull your shine for somebody else." – Tyra Banks:</strong> This quote for me means that <em>you shouldn't change who you are</em> because of others; you must shine and be confident in all you do, regardless of what others think. People that truly care about you will be there to support you.</li>
  <li><strong>“Family and friends are hidden treasures, seek them and enjoy their riches.” – Wanda Hope Carter:</strong> In our life, we have family and friends. We must take care of them because if we lose them, <em>we would be left with nothing</em>; thus, we must value them beyond everything else.</li>
  <li><strong>“Love yourself unconditionally, just as you love those closest to you despite their faults.” —Les Brown:</strong> This is significant because we love people with all of <em>their imperfections</em>, but we are often incapable of loving ourselves with all of our defects. That is why, just as we give love to others, we must also give love to ourselves and accept ourselves for who we are.</li>
